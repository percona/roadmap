### Goal

Public roadmaps are created to involve community into the process of shaping the product roadmap and keeping community informed about the progress to deliver the most wanted features. Anyone can submit new [Issues](https://github.com/percona/roadmap/issues) or upvote existing ones to influence the roadmap.

### Bugs and questions

The roadmap is all about new features or significant improvements. 
* To submit a bug please use Percona JIRA instead. Please see instructions on the product's page in github.
* For general questions or help please use [Percona Community Forum](https://forums.percona.com/)

### JIRA

Our engineering teams use our public [JIRA](https://jira.percona.com/) for development tracking. Most of the items in the roadmap have JIRA ticket IDs in the titles (ex. K8SPXC-530) for integration and easier mapping.

## FAQs
**Q: Why public roadmaps?**

A: We want to learn which features are the most important for the community and our customers and we want to show where we are with implementing the desired functionality.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Quality of our products is the top priority, we are careful with providing estimates for features. We might later add the labels to provide the ETAs.

**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**

A: We track our development in our public [JIRA](https://jira.percona.com) and sync roadmap items manually. Something might slip. Please open the issue if you see that something is missing!

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

A: Please open an issue. Feature ideas will be tagged "Proposed" and will be reviewed by the team.
